## Task
The problem can be divided into several subproblems such as entering a text and reading it(1), counting the symbols (2), printing the counting in the alphanumberic order (3). After completion of all these tasks the code has eventually worked.

## Description
It is a code which enables you to count all the symbols which it is given. You only need to enter ./my_ngram "X", where X is any text every symbol of which you would like to be counted. 
It has taken a several days. In order to understand some new concepts for me, e.g. flags -Wall etc. Also, MAX_ARRAY_SIZE 128, ASCII table (refreshing my memory), char **av thing (starting the index by 1) etc.

## Installation
You don't need any additional installation. Just: 1/ go to ex00 (by entering ex00 in the terminal line); 2/ type: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o my_ngram my_ngram.c; 3/ type: ./my_ngram "X", where X is your text of choice

## Usage
Just enter make. gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror will appear.  after that enter:
./my_ngram XX. where XX is your text. You might also want to enter several texts. to do so you need to enter each text in "" separately, e.g.: ./my_ngram "text1" "text2"

### The Core Team
The team was me only. Since I could not find a partner for quite a long time. It was good experience for me in designing the solution all by myself: testing the hypothesis of possible solutions, coding, correcting mistakes and then implementing it.
